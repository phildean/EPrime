# EPrime
These are short example EPrime Scripts

This repository contains example scripts for a short, simple Continuous Performance Task and a Go Nogo task programmed in E-Prime, along with example modifications of the Go Nogo Task for EEG and MRI. 

They are programmed in E-Prime 2 (EP2Pro2.0.10.356) 

- **except those with _E3 at the end of the folder, which are programmed in E-Prime 3**

Although these do run and function as experiments, and are based on descriptions of tasks within two published papers, they are to be used more as example scripts of a simple experiment, and some of the modifications that could help with EEG and MRI. 

Always run these experiments first to check their validity for your needs, and to check that they perform as you expect before using in an experimental setting. 

For constructing these tasks, i have relied heavily on the tutorial scripts, and the videos of Andrew Jahn on E-Prime, as well as the manual, some online help and forums and E-Primer website.
